        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          We are very happy that you are joining the community of developers
          building with Wunderlist 2.0—welcome aboard! We’ve designed these
          guideline so that you can get your creation out the door without
          having to negotiate legal agreements for each use of our brand and
          assets—including our logo, content and trademarks. To use our marks in
          a way that is not covered by these guidelines, please contact us via
          support@wunderlist.com and include a visual mockup of intended use.
        </p>

          <h2>The Wunderlist 2.0 brand</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re creating an app, website or other service designed to be
            used with Wunderlist, give it a distinctive name. It’s fine to say
            the product is for use with Wunderlist as long as you pick a
            distinct brand for your product. Don’t use “Wunder” or “Wunderlist”
            in the name. Don't register a domain name containing “wunder,”
            “wunderlist” or any misspellings, transliterations or similar
            variations on Wunderlist. Visuals for your app or service: Design
            your app and website (as well as badges, avatars and graphics
            associated with them) with branding and logos that distinguish your
            brand from ours.
